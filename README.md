Hakutaku is an authenticated, random-access resource package designed for
offline games and optimized for visual-novel content. Its packing and runtime
policies account for many small scripts and UI assets, seekable voice, music,
and video streams, large backgrounds and character images, scene-local
lookahead, and patch-friendly resource replacement. A release consists of one
signed `game.haku` snapshot and a small set of immutable, content-addressed
`.taku` segments. The wire format remains general enough for other offline
games; the reference policy is tuned for visual novels.

The repository is intentionally split by responsibility:

- `hakutaku-core`: the only crate linked by a game runtime;
- `hakutaku-pack`: publisher identity, full/incremental bundle construction;
- `hakutaku`: command-line pack/list/extract/verify tool;
- `hakutaku-gui`: optional resource, release, and publisher-identity manager.

The v2 wire format has one cryptographic suite: AES-256-GCM for encrypted
catalogs, pages, and blocks, Ed25519 for publisher identity, and BLAKE3 for
content addresses and signed commitments. It does not contain an algorithm
identifier or compatibility branch.

This directory is an independent Cargo workspace so it can be moved into its
own repository without inheriting Kēne's dependency graph.

## Quick start

```sh
# Create once and keep this publisher file private.
cargo run -p hakutaku-cli -- identity create publisher.hakutaku-key

# Export the non-signing material used by runtime/read-only tools.
cargo run -p hakutaku-cli -- identity export-runtime \
  publisher.hakutaku-key game.hakutaku-runtime-key

# Build or incrementally update a complete release directory.
cargo run -p hakutaku-cli -- pack \
  --input path/to/assets \
  --output path/to/release \
  --identity publisher.hakutaku-key \
  --deferred-prefix dlc

# Verify every immutable segment, or inspect the file table.
cargo run -p hakutaku-cli -- verify \
  --package path/to/release --keys game.hakutaku-runtime-key
cargo run -p hakutaku-cli -- list \
  --package path/to/release --keys game.hakutaku-runtime-key
cargo run -p hakutaku-cli -- segments \
  --package path/to/release --keys game.hakutaku-runtime-key

# Inspect source changes, build and verify releases, and manage identities.
cargo run -p hakutaku-gui
```

Set **Assets**, **Output**, and **Key** once. Use **Scan → Build → Verify**.
The icons show the workflow; change bars show added, changed, removed, and
unchanged files. File access/install details and longer explanations appear on
hover. Import, replace, search, and reveal remain in the file list.

**Reuse blocks** is independent of **Dev cache**. The **Strict** badge means full
source reads and staged byte comparison; this is the default. Opt into Dev
cache under **Options** for local iteration only. Full builds disable it.
**Details** contains build/package statistics; **Key tools** manages the shared
publisher identity. Changing paths clears old results and selections.

Only `game.haku`, `data/*.taku`, and the runtime's equivalent embedded key
material belong in the shipped game. The `*.hakutaku-key` publisher identity
contains both the content root key and Ed25519 signing private key; never ship
or commit it. `*.hakutaku-runtime-key` contains the content decryption secret
and public verification key but cannot sign a release. It is suitable for
read-only tooling, not for public distribution as a loose file. The packer and
GUI reject either key format as an asset by file magic, regardless of filename.

Incremental packing reuses chunks from the active release. Identical chunks in
the same placement class are also deduplicated during the first release, so
copied assets with the same access policy are encrypted and stored only once.
Scripts, UI files, and small configuration up to 32 KiB are marked `Hot`.
Short voice/SFX audio up to 1 MiB is `Transient`, while BGM/music, longer
audio, and video are `Streaming`; media classification takes precedence over
size. Other assets enter the bounded second-hit `Normal` cache. The reference
packer keeps each availability/access class in its own
bounded segment stream: 64 MiB for Hot, 256 MiB for Normal, 128 MiB for
Transient, and up to the configured limit (512 MiB by default) for Streaming.
These are upper bounds rather than padded target sizes. Deferred content is
also isolated; required and deferred blocks never share a segment.
See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the allocation policy and the local
Unity- and Unreal-shaped I/O regression baseline.

## Runtime and update integration

The runtime opens and authenticates `game.haku` first. `Package::list_segments`
then exposes the signed ID, byte length, and `Required`/`Deferred` availability
of every immutable segment. Installers can download only missing content while
the game supplies storage through the dependency-free `SegmentSource` and
`PositionedFile` traits. A missing on-demand segment returns
`Error::SegmentUnavailable(id)`; networking and retry policy stay outside the
format reader.

Sequential cursors reuse their ciphertext and decompression buffers and keep
the current and previous Streaming blocks for short decoder seeks. Engines can
schedule `Asset::prefetch_range` on their existing task pool; its dedicated
cache is bounded by `ResourceBudget::prefetch_cache_bytes` and creates no
Hakutaku-owned threads.

`Asset::read_at` remains the convenient one-shot random-access API. Code that
performs repeated reads should retain an `AssetCursor` for sequential/seekable
decoders or an `AssetReadSession` for offset-based engine APIs; both preserve
the active segment handle and decode buffers across calls.

The signed `release_sequence` prevents undetectable edits but cannot by itself
remember a previously accepted version. A launcher should persist its highest
accepted sequence and pass `OpenPolicy::requiring(sequence)` to
`Package::open` or `Package::open_directory`. Hakutaku
then rejects a correctly signed older snapshot without owning platform state.
The first trusted install must deliberately pass `OpenPolicy::TrustFirstRelease`;
there is no implicit rollback-permitting open path.

This boundary works with desktop files, Android/iOS asset storage, memory maps,
or a platform download manager without adding an HTTP client or async runtime
to `hakutaku-core`. Snapshot and segment reads are positional and safe to share
between concurrent cursors.

Publisher writes use synchronized temporary files, verified staging, atomic
snapshot replacement, Unix directory synchronization, and post-commit garbage
collection. Interrupted `.part` files are removed only after the exclusive
build lock is acquired. If a process is killed while packing, confirm no packer
is still running before removing a reported stale `.hakutaku.lock`.

For local 20–40 GiB VN iteration, incremental builds may opt into
`--dev-cache`. The release-local cache records source size, modification time,
available file identity, and authenticated chunk metadata so unchanged voices
do not need to be reread merely to rediscover their chunks. It is bound to the
project and active release sequence; corrupt or stale caches are ignored.
`--full` cannot be combined with it, and normal/final builds retain complete
source rereads and byte-for-byte staged verification. After a successful GUI
incremental build, the post-build plan validates the complete path/size/access
inventory without immediately rereading every source body.

Full builds preserve and advance the authenticated release sequence even when
rebuilding unchanged source or recovering missing old segments. An existing
snapshot must authenticate; `--full` does not reset the launcher's rollback floor.

Hakutaku 0.2.0 reads and writes **v2 only**. Existing v1 packages require a full
source repack into a fresh directory using the same identity; pass
`--release-sequence-floor N` above the last published sequence. Deploy the new
runtime with its matching package. There is no legacy format fallback.

See [docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md) for the implemented byte layout and
[performance evidence](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#next-format-design-evidence) for the
measured design choices. The compact catalog uses 8-byte path slots and 32-byte
positional chunk IDs; headers are 256/128 bytes. Audio uses 64 KiB blocks,
video retains 256 KiB, and image CDC remains unchanged. Bounded publisher
consolidation prevents small patch segments accumulating indefinitely.

## Validation

Hakutaku requires Rust 1.99.0. The same version is pinned for local development
and CI in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Local acceptance uses:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check --workspace --locked --all-targets --all-features
cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked --all-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --locked -p hakutaku-core -p hakutaku-pack --no-deps
cargo llvm-cov --locked -p hakutaku-core -p hakutaku-pack --fail-under-lines 97.5
cargo llvm-cov --locked -p hakutaku-cli --fail-under-lines 45
cargo bench --locked --workspace
```

The larger VN benchmark is opt-in because it creates 10k/50k/100k-entry
fixtures. A 10k smoke run and the complete matrix are:

```sh
HAKUTAKU_VN_BENCH=1 HAKUTAKU_VN_BENCH_COUNTS=10000 \
  cargo bench -p hakutaku-pack --bench vn_runtime
HAKUTAKU_VN_BENCH=1 cargo bench -p hakutaku-pack --bench vn_runtime
```

Every successful push to `main` creates the next patch tag and publishes the
CLI and GUI builds, together with `SHA256SUMS`, on GitHub Releases. The first
automated tag follows `workspace.package.version`; later releases increment its
patch component. Raise the workspace version explicitly to start a new minor or
major line.

Publisher-key storage, CI trust, and platform signing boundaries are documented
in [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

Both library crates deny missing public API documentation. CI therefore keeps
public rustdoc coverage at 100%. The canonical wire-format parser is held at
100% line coverage; the combined runtime and publisher baseline is 97.5% or
higher, and CLI argument handling has a 45% regression floor. The remaining
lines are operating-system and cryptographic-provider failure returns that
cannot be triggered deterministically without replacing the production
backends.

## v2 acceptance

The complete 0.2.0 workspace passes Rust 1.99.0 fmt, all-target/all-feature
check and Clippy, 83 tests, and public documentation with warnings denied.
Fresh coverage targets report Core/Pack 97.63%, wire parser 100%, CLI 53.42%;
the existing thresholds remain unchanged. The initial mixed-version coverage
target is excluded from acceptance. Actionlint passes.

The 500k-resource, 1,024-update and eight-reader stress cases pass. Real v1/v2
binaries reject each other's wire format; identity reuse and release floors
are checked. See [integrated results](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#integrated-v2-results)
for paired measurements, tradeoffs and raw evidence. Kēne's local integration
passes its workspace gates, all 196 Loader tests and 29 publisher tests, both
native/FFmpeg media acceptance commands, and the existing dependency policy.
The local macOS debug GUI passes direct native checks of the single-workspace
flow: shared paths, collapsed identity/advanced/statistics sections, same-size
source change detection with preserved mtime, strict incremental build, release
verification, and independent cache/reuse controls. The demo build advances
release 42 to 43 with 199 reused blocks and one new block; verification succeeds.
Full mode disables the development cache and keeps strict validation. Its ad-hoc
signature verifies. This covers the local debug app; release artifacts and
Windows/Linux GUI acceptance remain separate.
Publishing a portable Git dependency and remote release/CI remain separate.

## Quality-review baseline (before v2)

The workspace review covers every crate, with runtime and publisher paths as
the priority. Scope coverage is not a claim of exhaustive proof.

| Module | Reviewed paths and resulting changes |
|---|---|
| Core | Authenticated format/crypto, positional I/O, pages, segments, budgets, prefetch and cursors; remove quadratic cache insertion and path-validation allocation; share cursor/session block loading and preserve cursor position on read errors |
| Pack | Source inventory/classification, identities, planning, chunking, dedup, cache parsing, staging, recovery and commit; bound reads and allocations before parsing, handle short reads correctly, use standard file replacement, preserve monotonic release ordering during full reconstruction |
| CLI | Argument/error paths, identity/runtime-key separation, package open, verification and confined extraction; retain the existing public command contract |
| GUI | Worker lifecycle, progress, resource filtering/selection, import/replace, release and identity flows; use egui visible-row rendering, cache filtering, throttle progress, handle worker creation failures, and scroll long release/identity pages |
| Dependencies/CI | Rust/MSRV, direct dependencies, feature graph, coverage, native/mobile build jobs and release gates; pin Rust 1.99.0 and lock resolution, add native platform tests |

Direct dependencies now use eframe 0.36.2, rfd 0.17.2, zstd 0.14.2 and
FastCDC 5.0.0; the lockfile also advances BLAKE3 to 1.8.7 and zeroize to 1.9.1.
The redundant direct egui dependency is removed in favor of eframe's re-export.
No new direct crate or runtime framework is introduced. FastCDC keeps the same
32/128/512 KiB parameters; its updated API uses `usize`. The native zstd version
remains 1.5.7. See the [FastCDC changelog](https://docs.rs/crate/fastcdc/5.0.0/source/CHANGELOG.md)
and [eframe release](https://github.com/emilk/egui/releases/tag/0.36.2).

On Apple Silicon macOS with Rust 1.99.0, fmt, all-target/all-feature check and
Clippy, documentation, and 76 workspace tests pass, including the later
full-rebuild sequence regression. Before that follow-up, measured line coverage
was 97.59% for Core/Pack, 53.29% for CLI, and 100% for the wire-format parser;
coverage was not remeasured after the sequence fix. Existing coverage thresholds
are unchanged. Actionlint passes with its optional
shellcheck/pyflakes integrations disabled.

The dependency review, before the sequence follow-up, verified that old and
new dependency builds read each other's v1 packages byte-for-byte;
new strict and development-cache incremental builds preserve an unchanged old
snapshot and its segments. The fixture covers compressed text, raw video,
empty files and deterministic random data with an odd tail. New full and
incremental packages also pass the old dependency build's verifier/extractor.
These two CLI builds both contain this review's reader fixes; the comparison
isolates dependency compatibility. A separate archive of Kēne `6635d1f`, patched
only to consume this local Core/Pack, passes all 196 Loader tests. Kēne's live
checkout and dependency pins were unchanged during that baseline review.

Native macOS acceptance directly exercised scanning 305 temporary assets,
scrolling and filtering the resource list, incremental build, unchanged rebuild,
verification and scrolling the complete release report. The local debug app's
ad-hoc signature also verifies. This is not acceptance of a release artifact:
remote CI, Windows/Linux GUI operation and mobile targets still need their
own builds/runs. Dependency-policy boundaries are recorded in
[SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md#dependency-review-boundary), and measured results
in [PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#bounded-cache-population).
Raw local evidence is under the ignored `target/quality-review/` directory.
